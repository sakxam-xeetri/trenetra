## 🔧 Configuration

### **OTA (Over-The-Air) Updates** 🆕
Update firmware wirelessly without USB cable!

1. In Arduino IDE, go to **Tools → Port**
2. Select **Network Ports** → **trinetra at 1.2.3.4**
3. Click **Upload** (will ask for password: `trinetra123`)
4. Wait for upload to complete
5. Device will auto-reboot with new firmware

**To change OTA password**, edit in `trinetra.ino`:
```cpp
ArduinoOTA.setPassword("your_password_here");
```

### **Change Access Point Settings**
Edit in `trinetra.ino`:
```cpp
const char *ap_ssid     = "YourCustomSSID";
const char *ap_password = "YourPassword";  // Min 8 chars, or "" for open AP
```

### **Adjust Default Camera Settings**
Edit in `trinetra.ino` → `setup()`:
```cpp
config.frame_size   = FRAMESIZE_QVGA;     // QQVGA, QVGA, VGA, SVGA, XGA, SXGA, UXGA
config.jpeg_quality = 12;                  // 0-63 (lower = better)
config.fb_count     = 2;                   // 1 or 2 (dual buffer needs PSRAM)
```

### **Enable/Disable SD Card**
SD card is auto-detected. If not present, save-to-SD will show error message. No code changes needed.

### **LED Flash Brightness**
Edit in `app_httpd.cpp`:
```cpp
#define CONFIG_LED_MAX_INTENSITY 255  // 0-255
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Camera Init Failed**
- **Check**: PSRAM is enabled in Arduino IDE settings
- **Check**: Partition scheme has at least 3MB APP space
- **Check**: Camera ribbon cable is properly connected
- **Fix**: Auto-reboot after 3 seconds

### **Video Stream Not Loading**
- **Check**: Connected to `Trinetra_AP` Wi-Fi
- **Check**: Accessing `http://1.2.3.4` (not HTTPS)
- **Check**: Port 81 is not blocked by firewall
- **Fix**: Click Start button, ensure stream URL is `http://1.2.3.4:81/stream`

### **SD Card Not Detected**
- **Check**: SD card is formatted as FAT32
- **Check**: SD card is properly inserted before power-on
- **Note**: AI-Thinker shares GPIO 4 with flash LED - SD init uses 1-bit mode

### **Can't Upload Sketch**
- **Check**: GPIO 0 is connected to GND during upload
- **Check**: TX/RX are not swapped on FTDI adapter
- **Check**: Correct COM port selected
- **Check**: Board set to "AI Thinker ESP32-CAM"

### **Compile Errors**
- **Error**: `PROGMEM not defined` → ESP32 board support not installed
- **Error**: `Camera init failed` → Wrong board selected or PSRAM disabled
- **Fix**: Update ESP32 board package to latest version

### **Low FPS / Choppy Stream**
- **Reduce** resolution to QVGA or QQVGA
- **Increase** JPEG quality value (15-25)
- **Check** Wi-Fi signal strength
- **Disable** other devices on the AP

## 🎯 Performance Tips

1. **For Smooth Streaming**: Use QVGA (320×240) with quality 10-12
2. **For High Quality Photos**: Switch to XGA/SXGA before capture
3. **Battery Operation**: Lower resolution and increase quality value to reduce power
4. **Multiple Viewers**: Reduce FPS by increasing quality value
5. **Range Extension**: Use external antenna on ESP32-CAM

## 🔐 Security Notes

⚠️ **This is a basic implementation for personal/educational use**

- Default AP password (`88888888`) should be changed for security
- No encryption on video stream (HTTP, not HTTPS)
- No authentication on web interface
- Suitable for isolated networks or temporary setups

**For production use**, consider adding:
- HTTPS with SSL certificates
- User authentication (Basic Auth or OAuth)
- Access control lists (ACL)
- Encrypted storage for sensitive photos
